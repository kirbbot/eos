PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Device Information:  When you visit the SitePortal, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the SitePortal, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the SitePortal, and information about how you interact with the SitePortal. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”
We collect Device Information using the following technologies: 
1) “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.  
2) “Log files” track actions occurring on the SitePortal, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps. 
3) “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the SitePortal. 
Member Information:  Additionally, when you become a TILC member of TILC Community Connections, we collect certain information from you, including your name, email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as “Member Information.” When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Member Information.
Email Communications with Us: You may occasionally receive email and other communications from us. Administrative communications relating to your Membership (e.g., for purposes of account recovery or password reset) are considered part of our service to you and you may not be able to opt-out of receiving those communications. We also may send you other kinds of emails, which you can opt-out of either from your Account Settings page or by using the “Opt-Out” link in the emails themselves. Note that we will never email you to ask for your password or other account information; if you receive such an email, please forward it to us. 
We send two kinds of email: emails regarding activities on the SitePortal or within the TILC Community, and ones others with important information about your account. You can opt out of the former, but not the latter. 
Information about Your Accounts on Third Party Services: You can link your membership account to certain third-party services such as social media platforms and payment management services. In order to do so, you may provide us with your username or other user ID for a third-party service, and you may then be required to log into that service. After you complete this login process, we will receive a token that allows us to access your account on that service so that we can, for example, post your content to that service when you ask us to. We do not receive or store your passwords for your third-party service accounts. 
Information Obtained from Third Party Services: In some cases, we partner with Third Party Services that may provide information about you. When you connect other services to your TILC membership account, those services might share information about you with us. What gets shown to us is determined by their privacy policies, which you should read before connecting your TILC account with those services. 
User Content: User Content entered into a Member profile is owned by that Member, who can use settings to determine who can view it.  The privacy setting for basic member information is initially set to “public”By default, but most other information defaults to a more restrictive setting that can be changed at the Member’s discretion.  all sharing through the SitePortal is public, andsoTo be safe, when you provide us with content , it is published so we recommend that you assume anyone can view it and diligently manage your data settings as appropriate. Although we do provide tools, like password-protected blogs, that let you publish content privately, you should assume that anything you publish is publicly accessible unless you have explicitly selected otherwise . Also, please keep in mind that anything you share privately with another user could be captured and posted publicly by that user. Content published and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines, and you may lose any privacy rights you might have regarding that content. In addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet, including through actions or features available through the SitePortal, such as reblogging. 
Native Actions: The SitePortal allows you to perform native actions such as liking a post, reblogging a post, replying to a post, and following a blog. Liking, reblogging, and replying are public actions – anyone can expand the “notes” view on a post, for example, to see who liked, reblogged, or replied to a post. We use information about native actions to improve the SitePortal, develop new services, and, to personalize your experience. Personalization using this information may include presenting you with new posts relevant to what you’ve liked and providing you with better search results. 
Information About User Content: In some cases, we may collect information about content you provide to the SitePortal. For example, when it's included as part of your images, we may collect information describing your camera, camera settings and similar technical information.  This information allows us to improve the SitePortal and provide additional features and functionality.

CALIFORNIA DISCLOSURES
If you’re a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information about how we collect, use, and disclose your “personal information,” as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"). 
Throughout our privacy policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect, the sources of that information, and how we share it. Under the CCPA, we also have to provide you with the "categories" of personal information we collect and disclose for “business purposes” (as those terms are defined by applicable law). Those categories are identifiers (such as username and email address); commercial information (such as transaction data); financial data (such as credit card and other financial account information); internet or other network or device activity (such as unique identifiers, browsing history or other usage data); geolocation information (general location); inference data about you; legally protected classifications (such as gender); physical characteristics or description (such as when you voluntarily submit a photo); or other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you. 
We use these categories of personal information consistent with the various business and commercial purposes we describe in this privacy policy. Check out “Personal Information We Collect” and “How We Use Your Personal Information” to learn more. We share this information with the categories of third parties described above in “Sharing Your Personal Information." 
We may also use the categories of personal information for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We may aggregate the information we collect or de-identify it in order to limit or prevent the identification of any particular user or device. 
California Privacy Rights
If you’re a California resident, the CCPA provides you with rights regarding your personal information.

You can access much of your information by logging in to your account. You can also request a personal data report by submitting a request in the Privacy section of your Settings. You need to be signed in to your account to submit this request, and you will have to log in to your account to access the summary or the report. If you want to request the summary described above, require additional assistance, or if you do not have an account, submit a support ticket here or email us at ccpa@tilc.com. 
Delete: The CCPA also gives you the right to delete certain information we have about you. You can delete much of your information by logging in to your account. If you cannot do this, or you do not have an account, please submit a support ticket here, or email us at ccpa@tilc.comthe-ilc.org.
Financial Incentives: You may have the right to receive information about any financial incentives that we offer to you. 
Consequences of Exercising Rights: You also have the right not to be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights. 
Certain information may be exempt from these rights under applicable law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide you with the services available through the SitePortal. If you ask us to delete them, you may no longer be able to access or use those SitePortals. 
Before we can satisfy your request, you’ll need to give us enough information so that we can be certain of your identity. To do that, you’ll need to log in to your account or give us certain information about you and/or your use of the SitePortal. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you have to give us written authorization for the agent to act on your behalf. You’ll still need to verify your identity directly with us.
