                <h1>What we believe in</h1>
                <ul>
                        <li>
                                <h3>With hope and inspiration, all things are possible.</h3>
                                <p>“Hope is being able to see that there is light despite all of the darkness.” – Desmond Tutu</p>
                                <p>"There's no need to be perfect to inspire others.  Let people get inspired by how you deal with your imperfections." - Kurt Tasche</p>
                                <p>We believe that hope can lead to inspiration, inspiration can lead to inspired action, inspired action can lead to personal evolution, and that enough personal evolution can lead to societal revolution.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <h3>Life transitions are catalysts for personal growth.</h3>
                                <p>It seems we grow more during times of change because change shakes us out of our comfort zones and forces us to adapt. Major life transitions can shake us to our core and cause us to grow and evolve in character-defining ways. The bad news is we all go through them. The good news is  that we're all stronger than we know and we will find that strength when tested. We believe that if we keep the light of hope burning the fire of change will help us become more of who we're meant to be.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <h3>New ways, new systems, and new leaders are needed.</h3>
                                <p>Society as we know it is going through massive shifts right before our eyes - old ways and old systems are breaking down, and some of them can't and maybe shouldn't be fixed. New ways and new systems that are built on collaboration, compassion, fairness, generosity, kindness, and love must arise to replace them, and we need to identify and rally around leaders that embody those qualities. We believe that everyone has important roles to play and that one of ours is to provide a safe place offering people a place to belong and to contribute to something better.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <h3>Real. Connected. Community. The old way can become a new way, leading to something better.</h3>
                                <p>What passes for "community" today often seems to pale in comparison with what "used to be". There's a knowing inside us that we've lost a connection with those around us and maybe even with ourselves; that we've traded meaningful relationships with ourselves and others for busy-ness, for things, for distractions, for devices, and for shallow connections online. We believe that compassion, generosity, kindness and meaningful connection are fundamental to our nature and that if we provide a better community then people will choose to join it when they're ready.</p>
