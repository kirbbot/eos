<h1>THE INTENTIONAL LIVING COLLECTIVE and Eos COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS PORTAL PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit the The Intentional Living Collective (“TILC”) Website and Eos Community Connections Portal (the “Portal”). By accessing the Portal on any computer, mobile phone, tablet, or other device, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. This policy is part of the Eos Community Connections Portal Terms of Use Agreement; if you do not agree to this Agreement, you may not use the Portal.</p>

<h4>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
<p><strong>Device Information:</strong> When you visit the Portal, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Portal, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Portal, and information about how you interact with the Portal. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”</p>
<p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>
<ul class="numbered">
        <li>
                <p>1) “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org.">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
                <p>2) “Log files” track actions occurring on the Portal, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
                <p>3) “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Portal. </p>
        </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Member Information:</strong>  Additionally, when you become a TILC member, we collect certain information from you, including your name, email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as “Member Information.” When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Member Information.</p>
<p><strong>Email Communications with Us:</strong> You may occasionally receive email and other communications from us. Administrative communications relating to your Membership (e.g., for purposes of account recovery or password reset) are considered part of our service to you and you may not be able to opt-out of receiving those communications. We also may send you other kinds of emails, which you can opt-out of either from your Account Settings page or by using the “Opt-Out” link in the emails themselves. <strong>Note that we will never email you to ask for your password or other account information; if you receive such an email, please forward it to us at contact@the-ilc.org.</strong>
We send two kinds of email: emails regarding activities on the Portal or within the TILC Community, and otherswith important information about your account. You can opt out of the former, but not the latter.</p>
<p><strong> Information about Your Accounts on Third Party Services:</strong> You can link your membership account to certain third-party services such as social media platforms and payment management services. In order to do so, you may provide us with your username or other user ID for a third-party service, and you may then be required to log into that service. After you complete this login process, we will receive a token that allows us to access your account on that service so that we can, for example, post your content to that service when you ask us to. We do not receive or store your passwords for your third-party service accounts.</p> 
<p><strong>Information Obtained from Third Party Services:</strong> In some cases, we partner with Third Party Services that may provide information about you. When you connect other services to your TILC membership account, those services might share information about you with us. What gets shown to us is determined by their privacy policies, which you should read before connecting your TILC account with those services.</p>
<p><strong>User Content:</strong> User Content entered into a Member profile is owned by that Member, who can use settings to determine who can view it.  The privacy setting for basic member information is initially set to “public”, but most other information defaults to a more restrictive setting that can be changed at the Member’s discretion.  To be safe, when you provide us with content we recommend that you assume anyone can view it and diligently manage your data settings as appropriate. Also, please keep in mind that anything you share privately with another user could be captured and posted publicly by that user. Content published and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines, and you may lose any privacy rights you might have regarding that content. In addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet, including through actions or features available through the Portal, such as re-blogging.</p>
<p><strong>Native Actions:</strong> The Portal allows you to perform native actions such as liking a post, re-blogging a post, replying to a post, and following a blog. Liking, re-blogging, and replying are public actions – anyone can expand the “notes” view on a post, for example, to see who liked, re-blogged, or replied to a post. We use information about native actions to improve the Portal, develop new services, and, to personalize your experience. Personalization using this information may include presenting you with new posts relevant to what you’ve liked and providing you with better search results.</p> 
<p><strong>Information About User Content:</strong> In some cases, we may collect information about content you provide to the Portal. For example, when it's included as part of your images, we may collect information describing your camera, camera settings and similar technical information.  This information allows us to improve the Portal and provide additional features and functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Information Related to Use of the Services:</strong> We collect information about how people use the Portal. This type of information may be collected in our log files each time you interact with the Portal. We use internal tools and third-party applications and services to collect and analyze this information. Some of this information may also be associated with the Internet Protocol Address (“IP Address”) used to access the Portal; some may be connected with your membership account; and some may only be collected and used in aggregate form (for example, as a statistical measure that does not identify you or your account). We collect your IP Address when you make a post. We may use this information about how you and others interact with the Portal for a number of things generally related to enhancing, improving, protecting, and developing new services, including but not limited to: providing users with personalized content; improving our search results; identifying trending or popular content; fighting spam, malware, identity theft and generally keeping our users and community safe; and for legal and safety reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Information Related to Your Web Browser:</strong> We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Portal, such as your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your language preference, the date and time of each request you make to the Portal, your screen display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on your web browser. We also sometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser extensions and store that information in a manner associated with your account. We use web browser-related information to enhance and improve the Portal.</p>
<p><strong>Location Information:</strong> In some cases, we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP Address into a rough geolocation. We may also ask you to provide information about your location, for example to use your geolocation information from your mobile device to geotag a post. We may use location information to improve and personalize the Services for you, for example by showing you relevant local content.</p>
<p><strong>Information Related to Your Mobile Device: We may collect and store information related to your mobile device. In some cases, we may receive, generate, or assign your mobile device a unique identifier for the purposes described above in “Information Related to Use of the Services.” We may also ask you to provide your phone number to enable new services, such as by enabling multi-factor authentication for account login. We will always ask you for permission to collect and store your phone number.</strong></p> 

<h4>HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>We use Personal Information to: Communicate with you; screen your use of the Portal for potential risk or fraud; and when in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information relating to our services or activities. We may also share aggregated, anonymized data about Portal users with third parties.</p>
<p>We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize thePortal (for example, by generating analytics about how our members browse and interact with the Portal, and to assess the success of our community outreach).</p>
<h4>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>We are committed to the vision that Members own their own data, and we will not sell your personal information.  We never share information we receive from you unless: (a) we have your permission to share that information; (b) we have given you prior notice that the information will be shared, and with whom (such as in this Privacy Policy); or (c) that information is aggregated information or other information that does not identify you. </p>
<p>We may share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above.  For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Portal--you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.</a></p> 
<p>Information that you post in public areas of the Portal is, by its nature, publicly available.  You should have no expectation of privacy in any information that you post in those public areas.</p>
<p>We may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.</p>
<p>You may access third party websites through the Portal, for example by clicking on externally-pointing links. You may also choose to share information that you provide to us, like blog posts, with those third-party Portals (for example, by sharing posts to Twitter or Facebook). This Privacy Policy only governs information we collect and you are responsible for reading and understanding the privacy policies of any such third-party websites.</p>

<h4>BEHAVIOR-BASED COMMUNICATIONS</h4>
<p>As described above, we use your Personal Information to provide you with targeted communications we believe may be of interest to you. For more information about how targeted communication works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work." target="blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work.</a></p>

<h4>DO NOT TRACK</h4>
<p>Please note that we do not alter our Portal’s data collection and use practices when we see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.</p>

<h4>YOUR RIGHTS</h4>
<p>At this time, we are limiting TILC memberships to residents of the U.S.A. and Canada that are 18 years of age or older, though non-members can access the Portal and whatever content there is set to “Public” access.  If you are or become a resident of California or the European Union, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.</p>

<h4>SECURITY AND DATA RETENTION</h4>
<p>Your membership account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. We operate the Portal on a secure server that is presently maintained by SiteGround.  SiteGround employs state of the art security features, including the use of SSL certificates. We may change hosting services in the future, as our needs change.  We may enable additional security features in the future, like multi-factor authentication. For your part, you need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information by creating a unique, secure, and protected password and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account on the Portal. </p>
<p>We seek to protect your information to ensure that it is kept private; however, we can't guarantee the security of any information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. </p>
<p>It’s very important that you have a unique password for all of your accounts on the internet, including your membership account. If you have trouble remembering passwords, then you might consider using a service like <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword" target="_blank">1Password</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass.</a></p>
<p>We will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, for as long as your account is active. Please note that this applies to information in group chats as well. Even though we only make group chat messages available to the public (i.e., the other chat participants) for a short amount of time before their expiration and deletion from public view, group chat messages and related information (e.g., list of chat participants) will be retained by us for internal purpose (e.g., security audits), and/or as required by law (e.g., pursuant to a litigation hold notice) after they have disappeared from public view. If you no longer want us to use your information, you may close your account and we will delete the information we hold about you unless we need to retain and use your information to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements or as otherwise permitted by law.</p> 

<h4>CALIFORNIA DISCLOSURES</h4>
<p>If you’re a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information about how we collect, use, and disclose your “personal information,” as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA").</p>
<p>Throughout our privacy policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect, the sources of that information, and how we share it. Under the CCPA, we also have to provide you with the "categories" of personal information we collect and disclose for “business purposes” (as those terms are defined by applicable law). Those categories are identifiers (such as username and email address); commercial information (such as transaction data); financial data (such as credit card and other financial account information); internet or other network or device activity (such as unique identifiers, browsing history or other usage data); geolocation information (general location); inference data about you; legally protected classifications (such as gender); physical characteristics or description (such as when you voluntarily submit a photo); or other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.</p>
<p>We use these categories of personal information consistent with the various business and commercial purposes we describe in this privacy policy. Check out “Personal Information We Collect” and <a href="#" target="_blank">“How We Use Your Personal Information”</a> to learn more. We share this information with the categories of third parties described above in <a href="#" target="_blank">“Sharing Your Personal Information."</a></p>
<p>We may also use the categories of personal information for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We may aggregate the information we collect or de-identify it in order to limit or prevent the identification of any particular user or device. </p>
<h4>California Privacy Rights</h4>
<p>If you’re a California resident, the CCPA provides you with rights regarding your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Access:</strong> The CCPA gives you the right to request a copy of certain information we hold about you, as well as a summary of: the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months, the categories of sources of such information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting or sharing that information, and the categories of third parties with whom we shared that information.  You can access much of your information by logging in to your account. You can also request a personal data report by submitting a request in the Privacy section of your Settings. You need to be signed in to your account to submit this request, and you will have to log in to your account to access the summary or the report. If you want to request the summary described above, require additional assistance, or if you do not have an account, email us at <a href="mailto:ccpa@tilc.com" target="_blank">ccpa@tilc.com.</a></p> 
<p><strong>Delete:</strong> The CCPA also gives you the right to delete certain information we have about you. You can delete much of your information by logging in to your account. If you cannot do this, or you do not have an account, please email us at <a href="mailto:ccpa@tilc.com" target="_blank">ccpa@the-ilc.org.</a></p>
<p><strong>Financial Incentives:</strong> You may have the right to receive information about any financial incentives that we offer to you.</p>
<p><strong>Consequences of Exercising Rights:</strong> You also have the right not to be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights.</p>
<p>Certain information may be exempt from these rights under applicable law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide you with the services available through the Portal. If you ask us to delete them, you may no longer be able to access or use those Portals.</p>
<p>Before we can satisfy your request, you’ll need to give us enough information so that we can be certain of your identity. To do that, you’ll need to log in to your account or give us certain information about you and/or your use of the Portal. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you have to give us written authorization for the agent to act on your behalf. You’ll still need to verify your identity directly with us.</p>
<p>Learn how you can opt out by going to <a href="https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041012973" target="_blank">California: Do Not Sell My Personal Information.</a> If you are a California user who has told us you are under 16, you’ll see in your settings that we’ve already opted you out.</p>

<h4>WHAT INFORMATION YOU CAN ACCESS</h4>
<p>If you are a registered user, you can access most information associated with your Account by logging into the Portal and checking your Account Settings page. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings.</p> 
<h4>CHANGES</h4>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.  Any updates will become effective when they are posted to the Portal.  You should review this Privacy Policy periodically, to assure that you are informed of any changes to this Policy.</p>
